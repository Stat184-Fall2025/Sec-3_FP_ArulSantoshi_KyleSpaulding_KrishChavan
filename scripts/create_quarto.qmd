## Introduction

This report explores the relationship between national economic output (GDP) and Olympic performance in the Summer Olympics. Using cleaned and merged datasets, we analyze medal counts, efficiency metrics, and regression relationships to better understand how economic resources relate to athletic success.


## Setup

# Load required libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(broom)


## Data Collection

# Script 01: Scrape / load Summer Olympics data
source("01_scrape_summer_olympics_data.R")

## Data Cleaning

# Script 02: Clean Olympic medals data
source("02_clean_olympics_medals_summer_data.R")

# Script 03: Clean GDP data
source("03_clean_gdp_data.R")


## Data Merging

# Script 04: Merge GDP and Olympics data
source("04_merge_gdp_olympics.R")


## Standardization

# Script 05: Standardize medal counts
source("05_standardize_olympics_data.R")



## Exploratory Data Analysis

# Script 06: Exploratory analysis
source("06_exploratory_analysis.R")


## Regression Analysis

# Script 07: Regression analysis
source("07_regression_analysis.R")



## Efficiency Analysis

# Script 08: Efficiency metrics
source("08_efficiency_analysis.R")



## Final Visualizations

# Script 09: Final visualizations
source("09_final_visualizations.R")


## Key Findings

# GDP is positively correlated with total medal counts, though with diminishing returns.
# Several countries outperform GDP-based expectations, indicating higher efficiency.
# Regression residuals highlight nations that consistently over- or under-perform relative to economic size.


## Conclusion

While GDP is an important predictor of Olympic success, it does not fully explain Olympic performance. Other factors such as sports infrastructure, cultural emphasis on athletics, and targeted investment strategies play major roles in shaping national outcomes at the Olympics.
